## Overview

This document outlines the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process for the Launch application, focusing on best practices, deployment strategies, and monitoring. The process is implemented using GitHub Actions and AWS CDK for infrastructure deployment.

## Core Principles

1. **Reproducible Builds**
   - All dependencies explicitly defined in package.json
   - Use lock files (package-lock.json)
   - Consistent build environments using GitHub Actions
   - Automated validation steps

2. **Environment Consistency**
   - Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK
   - Environment variables managed through AWS Systems Manager
   - Separate configuration for different environments

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Pre-deployment test execution
   - Unit and integration test coverage
   - Automated validation of deployment success

## Current Workflow Implementation

### 1. Trigger Conditions
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
```

### 2. Test Job
- Runs on every push and pull request
- Uses Ubuntu latest runner
- Node.js v18 environment
- Validates code quality and functionality

### 3. Deployment Job
- Runs only on main branch pushes
- Requires successful test job completion
- Deploys infrastructure using AWS CDK
- Uses AWS credentials from GitHub Secrets

## Detailed Process Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
```

### 2. Dependency Management
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
```

### 3. Testing
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test
```

### 4. Infrastructure Deployment
```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

- name: Deploy infrastructure
  run: |
    cd aws/infrastructure
    npm install
    cdk deploy --require-approval never
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles with least privilege
   - AWS credentials stored in GitHub Secrets
   - Regular access reviews

2. **Secret Management**
   - AWS credentials managed through GitHub Secrets
   - Regular credential rotation
   - Secret usage auditing

3. **Network Security**
   - VPC endpoints
   - Security groups
   - Network traffic monitoring

## Monitoring and Validation

### 1. Health Checks
- Infrastructure deployment validation
- Service status monitoring
- Deployment event logging
- Build output verification

### 2. Rollback Procedures
- Maintain previous infrastructure state
- Document rollback steps
- Test rollback procedures

### 3. Logging
- Centralized logging
- Deployment context included
- Error rate monitoring

## Required GitHub Secrets

The following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for deployment
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for deployment

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Deployment success rate
   - Build time
   - Test coverage

2. **Regular Reviews**
   - Deployment procedures
   - Security practices
   - Build processes

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting steps
   - Runbooks

## Best Practices

1. **Code Quality**
   - Run tests before deployment
   - Validate infrastructure changes
   - Maintain clean code standards

2. **Deployment Safety**
   - Use infrastructure as code
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Monitor deployment progress

3. **Security**
   - Regular credential rotation
   - Least privilege access
   - Security scanning

## Conclusion

A robust CI/CD process requires:
- Clear documentation
- Automated testing
- Proper error handling
- Monitoring and validation
- Security considerations
- Continuous improvement

Regular reviews and updates to this process will help maintain a reliable deployment pipeline.
