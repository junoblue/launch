### Frontend Basic Setup

The frontend instance has been configured with a basic setup:

1. Directory Structure:
   ```

### Network Configuration (2024-04-15 01:25 UTC)

1. VPC Configuration:
   ```yaml
   VPC ID: vpc-0933ad5aedf63061d
   CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
   Status: available
   
   Subnets:
     Private (us-west-2a):
       - ID: subnet-0ed0f7d900f687231
       - CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24
       - Contains: Both frontend and backend instances
     
     Private (us-west-2b):
       - ID: subnet-0be2078d20cec6ee8
       - CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24
       - Purpose: Redundancy/HA
     
     Public (us-west-2a):
       - ID: subnet-00e4cbb289823451c
       - CIDR: 10.0.3.0/24
       - Purpose: NAT Gateway/Load Balancer
     
     Public (us-west-2b):
       - ID: subnet-0af0649bd70137e2a
       - CIDR: 10.0.4.0/24
       - Purpose: NAT Gateway/Load Balancer (redundancy)
   ```

2. Instance Network Configuration:
   ```yaml
   Frontend Instance:
     - Instance ID: i-04474421d6a28163d
     - Private IP: 10.0.1.144
     - Subnet: subnet-0ed0f7d900f687231 (Private us-west-2a)
     - Security Group: sg-0458a2bd52180c88d
   
   Backend Instance:
     - Instance ID: i-0a374e25291d206aa
     - Private IP: 10.0.1.36
     - Subnet: subnet-0ed0f7d900f687231 (Private us-west-2a)
     - Security Group: sg-0dfef8026145bb84f
   ```

3. Routing Configuration:
   ```yaml
   Private Subnet Route Table:
     - Local Route: 10.0.0.0/16
     - Internet Access: via NAT Gateway (nat-0099d46bbe39f520c)
     - VPC Endpoint: vpce-000535964f1882db1 (for AWS services)
   
   Public Subnet Route Table:
     - Local Route: 10.0.0.0/16
     - Internet Access: via Internet Gateway (igw-016d27b7e8bdab641)
   ```

4. Network Access:
   - âœ… Both instances in same private subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
   - âœ… NAT Gateway configured for outbound internet access
   - âœ… VPC Endpoint available for AWS service access
   - âœ… Redundant subnets in us-west-2b for high availability

5. Network Security:
   - âœ… Instances isolated in private subnet
   - âœ… Internet access controlled via NAT Gateway
   - âœ… Separate security groups for frontend and backend
   - âœ… AWS services accessible via VPC endpoints

6. Security Group Configuration:
   ```yaml
   Frontend (sg-0458a2bd52180c88d):
     Inbound Rules:
       - Port 80: Allow from 0.0.0.0/0 and VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
       - Port 443: Allow from VPC and specific security group
     Outbound Rules:
       - Allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/0)
     
   Backend (sg-0dfef8026145bb84f):
     Inbound Rules:
       - Port 80: Allow from VPC and specific security group
       - Port 8000: Allow from VPC (Application port)
       - Port 443: Allow from VPC and specific security groups
     Outbound Rules:
       - Allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/0)
   ```

7. Communication Paths:
   ```yaml
   Frontend to Backend:
     - HTTP (Port 80): Allowed via VPC CIDR rule
     - Application (Port 8000): Allowed via VPC CIDR rule
     - HTTPS (Port 443): Allowed via VPC CIDR rule
   
   Backend to Frontend:
     - HTTP (Port 80): Allowed via VPC CIDR rule
     - HTTPS (Port 443): Allowed via security group rule
   
   External Access:
     - Frontend: Accessible on port 80 from anywhere
     - Backend: Only accessible from within VPC
   ```

8. Security Recommendations:
   - Consider tightening frontend port 80 access to load balancer only
   - Review and potentially restrict outbound rules
   - Monitor and log security group changes
   - Implement additional layer of security with NACL if needed
