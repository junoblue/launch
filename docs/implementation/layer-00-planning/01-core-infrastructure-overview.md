# Core Infrastructure Planning Overview

> **Note**: This document contains the initial planning and verification status of our core infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Design (POC Phase)

This infrastructure is designed for a Proof of Concept (POC) deployment, optimized for cost-effectiveness while maintaining essential functionality and security.

### Key Infrastructure Decisions
- Single Availability Zone deployment for POC phase
- Instance selection optimized for POC workloads (t3.medium for services)
- Basic monitoring and alerting setup
- Simplified backup strategy
- Core security controls maintained
