## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- AWS CDK CLI
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Docker (for containerized deployments)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this template:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/project-template.git
   cd project-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

4. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cd aws/infrastructure
   cdk deploy
   ```

## Development

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The infrastructure is deployed using AWS CDK. The deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions.

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually:

```bash
cd aws/infrastructure
cdk deploy
```

### Backup and Rollback

The project includes a backup and rollback script:

```bash
# Create a backup
./scripts/backup-rollback.sh create

# List available backups
./scripts/backup-rollback.sh list

# Rollback to a specific backup
./scripts/backup-rollback.sh rollback <backup_name>
```

## Security

- All AWS credentials should be stored in GitHub Secrets
- Regular credential rotation is required
- Follow least privilege principle for IAM roles
- Enable security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Monitoring

- CloudWatch metrics for infrastructure
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and logging
- Health check endpoints
